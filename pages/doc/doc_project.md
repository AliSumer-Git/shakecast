{% include tip.html content="**Who should use ShakeCast**: businesses, utility and other lifeline managers, emergency responders, and others have an urgent need for information about the impact on their own facilities so they can make informed decisions and take quick actions to ensure safety, restore system functionality, and minimize losses." %}

{% include warning.html content="**Who should not use ShakeCast**: individual users without facility inventory or organizations that look for earthquake information infrequently." %}

## Release History

- ShakeCast V4 (beta, 2017)
- ShakeCast V3 (2015)
- ShakeCast V2 (2008)
- ShakeCast V1 (2004)

## Current Release (Version 3)

Critical users (lifeline utilities, for example) can receive automatic notifications within minutes of an earthquake indicating the level of shaking and the likelihood of impact to their own facilities.

The current release of ShakeCast is Version 3.0 (October, 2015). This is a significant rewrite from Version 2.0, and although it preserves the basic features and principles, it is advised that all users upgrade to Version 3 to add significant improvements in robustness, capabilities and features, and ease of installation and use. 

### Usage

USGS contracted with Gatekeeper Systems, Inc., Pasadena, to help develop the prototype ShakeCast system (Version 1.0). Early funding for ShakeCast was provided by the USGS and the American Lifelines Alliance (ALA), and it is now supported by the USGS under the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). Ongoing development is done in-house, with PHP consulting from Hungry Mind, Inc, in Boulder. Motivation and support for the development of ShakeCast (Version 2) was provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) under the guidance of Loren Turner.
