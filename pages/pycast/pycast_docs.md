Our team is in the midst of rebuilding ShakeCast from the ground up with relevation and powerfull technologies. V4 boasts more accurate potential impact assessment as well as a highly improved user experience. Beta testing will begin early in 2017; [Here](/shakecast/apidocs) is a link to the developer documentation.

Some of the improvements coming soon:

HAZUS AEBM
Using the newly developed HAZUS Advanced Engineering Building Module, ShakeCast V4 determines potential impact by analyzing multiple spectral accelerations. This provides a much clearer picture of the shaking and allows us to make more precise impact estimates than ever before.

User Interface Overhaul
The user interface is being completely redesigned to succinctly give users access to pertinent information. Auto-updating dashboards display earthquake impact in real time; leave it running on your extra monitor to transform your office into your own earthquake control room.

In-App Updates
The newest version of ShakeCast will utilize in-app updates; this means you'll no longer need to look for patches or come to the ShakeCast team to update your software.

Easy installation
For new ShakeCast users, the installation process will be the easiest yet. This has been acheived by using more portable technologies that will require less maintainence. 

Python
Although this is not a "new" programming language (over 25 years old!), it's widely used in the scientific community and tought in universities all over the world. Its simplicity and versitility guarantee its revelevence for years to come.

Angular 2
Many Javascript frameworks are fighting for popularity right now. Many of them are quite good, but Angular 2 stood out for a couple reasons. Among them are: its emphasis on compartmentalization and reusability of code, the seperation of the web application from the web server, and the use of integrated CSS3 graphics.
