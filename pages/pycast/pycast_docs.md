Our team is in the midst of rebuilding ShakeCast from the ground up using relevent and powerful technologies like Python and Angular 2. This new development boasts an easier installation, robust web interface, and higher accuracy in potential impact calculation. 

Beta testing will begin early in 2017. [Here](/shakecast/apidocs) is a link to the developer documentation.
