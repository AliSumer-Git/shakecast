## Global earthquake notification system developed by the IAEA for Mitigation & Response

In 2008, the IAEA launched the [International Seismic Safety Centre (ISSC)](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/seismic-safety/) to address how external hazards affect the safety of nuclear installations around the world. One important ISSC initiative was the development of the [Earthquake Notification System (ENS)](https://issc.iaea.org/web/eens.html) used for discovery, processing, and notification of real-time earthquake information at nuclear power plants and research reactors (with power higher than 1 MWt) around the world. The system has been running since November 2010, and was built on the United States Geological Survey’s ShakeCast system. 


The ISSC has developed a customized version of their software for use by Member States. Based on the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)’s long involvement with – and support of – the ISSC, CNSC received the pilot ENS version and from May 30 to June 1, 2016, a team of technical specialists from the Engineering Design Assessment Division (EDAD) received administrator training.
