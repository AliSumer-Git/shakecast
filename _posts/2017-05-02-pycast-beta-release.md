We're working hard to bring you this new version of ShakeCast, which is lightweight, fast, and accurate. Updates are still being made to this software, but we're ready (and excited) to get your feedback! You can install pyCast on Windows and Linux:

## Windows

Download the latest Windows installer [here](https://github.com/usgs/shakecast/releases/download/recent/pyCast_Installer-beta.exe).

Once downloaded, run the installer, and use your favorite web browser to navigate to your localhost.

To remove pyCast, navigate to the Shakecast folder in your user directory and run the uninstaller.

## Linux

The prefered method for installing pyCast on Linux is to do a pip installation. Your version of Linux must use Python 2.7.

Download and start pyCast:
~~~
pip install pycast-usgs
python -m shakecast start
~~~

Stop pyCast:
~~~
python -m shakecast stop
~~~

Remove pyCast:
~~~
python -m shakecast stop
pip uninstall pycast-usgs
~~~

## Logging in

On startup, a scadmin user account is created. You can log into your new pyCast instance using "scadmin" as both the username and password.

## Uploading Data

Drag and drop XML files generated by the [ShakeCast Inventory Workbook](/pages/workbook/ShakeCastInventory.xlsm) onto any page of the admin app.
