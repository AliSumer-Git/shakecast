On January 11, 2017, Caltrans (the Solicitation Lead Contact) closed the Transportation Pooled Fund Solicitation 1406, Connecting the DOTs: Implementing ShakeCast Across Multiple State Departments of Transportation for Rapid Post-Earthquake Response. The funding target had been met and the solicitation period closed with nine state DOT partners onboard.  

An initial web-teleconference meeting in February will be held to discuss the project, timeline, scope of work, and questions/concerns based on the draft scope of work.
