U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) to Support Nuclear ShakeCast Implementation
On September 9, 2016, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) entered into a five-year agreement to 
support the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for implementation and operation of a custom ShakeCast system – referred to as 
“Nuclear ShakeCast” – in order to better meet the unique real-time, post-earthquake information needs of the nuclear response 
organizations. The project is focused on making key enhancements to the existing Nuclear ShakeCast system by updating nuclear 
facility inventories and customizing reporting capabilities for USNRC. In addition, the USGS will also test and implement recent
scientific and algorithmic advances in the USGS ShakeMap system, particularly for response to earthquakes in the Central and Eastern U.S.
